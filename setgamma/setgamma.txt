Setgamma by Forest Hale (havoc@gamevisions.com), version 1.0

Setgamma is a commandline utility for setting hardware gamma in Windows, if
given no parameters it simply sets the gamma to default (intended for use with
my DarkPlaces engine, if it crashs, it leaves messed up gamma ramps), it can
be given a gamma value to set to (such as 1.3, 2.0, etc), making it a more
generally useful utility.
