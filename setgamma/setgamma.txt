Setgamma version 1.2 by Forest Hale and John Fitzgibbons

Setgamma is a commandline utility for setting hardware gamma on the primary
display device as well as 3DFX addon cards in Windows, if given no parameters
it simply sets the gamma to default (intended for resetting gamma after a
game crashs), it can be given a gamma value to set to (such as 1.3, 2.0,
etc), making it a more generally useful utility, for batch files and any
other uses one can imagine.
