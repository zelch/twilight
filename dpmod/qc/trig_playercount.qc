/*QUAKED trigger_playercount (0 .6 .8) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Triggers targets when enough players
join the game.

Recommended usage:
Wall off a room from the rest of the map
with vanishwalls/doors/etc, place this
somewhere, target the vanishwalls and
dm starts.
(vanishwalls vanish, dm starts activate)

Obviously this can trigger anything you
like. (func_train, etc)

Keys:
"count"
 how many players must join
"count2"
 if specified, this will immediately
 trigger and remove itself if
 maxplayers is at least this value.
 (can be used with count as well,
  although I can't imagine that being
  useful...)
"targetname"
 if targetted, this will not begin
 checking playercount until it is
 triggered.
 (works with count and count2)
