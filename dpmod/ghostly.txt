LordHavoc's 'ghostly' speedmod for Quake Expo 2006.

This is a dpmod-based modification and as such it requires DarkPlaces engine
to run.

Note this is a 3-hour speedmod, as I started so late in the 24 hour
speedmodding contest that I only had 2 hours left, and ended up going an hour
over the 24 hour limit in final balancing/playtesting, sorry for the lousy
presentation of this mod.

The features of this mod will be found in all future dpmod releases.

How to play:
Go through the start map as normal, but once you enter the main hub room,
type in the command "skill 5" without quotes, then proceed through any episode
exit of your choice, enjoy.  And good luck, you'll need it.

The speedmodding theme was making a new scarier Quake experience, preferably
inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's work, insanity is a favorite subject of his work.

Unfortunately I didn't work in any new H.P. Lovecraft inspired stuff; although
some might consider the new surprise at the end of each level to be vaguely
H.P. Lovecraft inspired, and playing this mod may carry a risk of paranoia :)

Warning: Anyone with a risk of heart-attack is advised not to play this for
their own safety.  Seriously.

This mod will probably be penalized in the QuakeExpo 2006 speedmodding contest
for being based on dpmod rather than id1 qc.
